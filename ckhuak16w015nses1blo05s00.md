# Day 3 of #100daysofcode:


Brand Identity

## Todayâ€™s Topic: Brand Identity

On Day 3, I worked on Brand Identity in my Skillcrush Course. It was meant to lead into web design and comps as well which is why I left as a part of my 100 days.

The focus was on creating an identity for a local based coffee company.

# Main Notes:

## Inspiration

I went scouring the popular places for ideas of the feel of the brand.

Sites I used:
â€¢ behance.com
â€¢ dribbble.com
â€¢ pinterest.com

I knew I wanted a rugged homey feel and ended up going for a rubber stamp look for the overall visual theme.

## **Naming**

I <span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">c</span></span>hose the name, **the** **Good Grind** from a short list. I thought it was catchy and liked it. It also wasnâ€™t taken so I was not going to get any copyright infringement that would hinder my creative process.

## **Color Palette**

I didnâ€™t really go looking for a color palette. I knew I wanted to use a multicolor option with brown, green and beige as the primary colors due to my UVP for the brand.

## UVP

The Good Grind is a sustainable, coffee brand. 80% of items used or sold are either reusable or recyclable. We are a no-plastic brand so items such as straws are made with either paper or metal. All coffee bags are made from burlap, paper, cardboard or for a premium â€” metal.

## Customer Avatar

Family-friendly, millennial-first brand. Think the local coffee shop where students feel comfortable enough to study, mom groups stop by during their day to chat and enjoy a cup of coffee and local businesses are often seen partnering and stopping by. Large emphasis on approachability and relationship over scale.

# Main Takeaways:

## 1\. Rubber Stamping from scratch is hard.

I donâ€™t recommend it personally but I liked my end result.

## 2\. Iconography can be fun.

I created these icons from scratch via Illustrator and just thinking about what I may need and how it may be used was fun.

**Icons:**
â€¢ menu
â€¢ food/boulangerie
â€¢ tea
â€¢ shop
â€¢ events
â€¢ gift (for gift cards)
â€¢ certified b corp
â€¢ kids
â€¢ gluten free
â€¢ vegan
â€¢ vegetarian friendly
â€¢ envelope (for newsletter)
