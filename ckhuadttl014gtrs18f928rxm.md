## Day 2 of #100DaysofCode:

Original date: July 25, 2020
# Todayâ€™s Topic: Comps & Wireframes

In my SkillCrush course, this particular module is in the Web Design Fundamentals Course.

The focus was on creating a wireframe for a personal portfolio page.

## Main Notes:

-  I created a style tile to guide the design with typography, colors, gradients and buttons.

## Main Takeaways:

I really like web design.

I donâ€™t mind making web comps but making them intuitively and with a higher grade of discernment of usability and simplicity is going to have to be the next focus.
Iâ€™m partial on lo-fi wireframes.

Itâ€™s a little harder for me to visual what I need with a lo-fi wireframe and maybe thatâ€™s just because I havenâ€™t seen lo-fis in the brainstorming process with like a team but on my own, probably not my go-to thing.
Making the wireframe, I realized I may be handing my developer a headache.

The thought came to mind that I may be designing something with functionality and intention but I have to be aware of the languages that my team and company are currently using to know whether we have the bandwidth to create certain features.
